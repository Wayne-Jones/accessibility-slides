          <h2>Why Accessibility is Important</h2>
          <p>Inaccessible websites means that people with disabilities are denied equal access to get information.</p>
          <p>Companies can be sued for not maintaining an accessible website </p>
          <aside class="notes">
            Inaccessible websites exclude people just as much as a physical location that has steps at an entrance. In a way excluding
            a person digitally is in a way a form of discrimination.<br/><br/>

            In addition, in the United States, companies could be held liable for failing to create an accessible website
            due to the Americans with Disabilities Act.

          <h2>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</h2>
          <p>ADA (enact. 1990, amend. 2008) is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination
            against people with disabilities in everyday activities.</p>
          <p>The ADA applies to State and Local Goverments (Title II) as well as Businesses that are open to the public
            (Title III).</p>          
          <p>In 2020 alone there has been more than 2500 Title III lawsuits regarding inaccessible websites</p>
          <p>Source: <a
              href="https://www.adatitleiii.com/2021/04/federal-website-accessibility-lawsuits-increased-in-2020-despite-mid-year-pandemic-lull/">Federal
              Website Accessibility Lawsuits Increased in 2020 Despite Mid-Year Pandemic Lull</a></p>

          <aside class="notes">
            Under Title III specifically, no individual may be discriminated against on the basis of disability with
            regards to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, or accommodations of any place
            of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases, or operates a place of public accommodation. <br/><br/>

            While not specificially mentioning websites in the Legislation, through court precedence, this act is
            assumed to extend beyond the physical space of businesses and governments - which would mean digital spaces
            including websites. Though in some circuit courts the website would have to be connected to a physical
            location whereas other circuit courts you can bring a lawsuit against an online-only business. <br/><br/>

            There have been an increasing number of Title III lawsuits over the years.

        <p>Time it takes to test</p>
        <p>Why improve on things you can't see</p>

        <aside class="notes">
          Time To Market - Because its a race to develop a fast viable working product. Accessibility is the last
          thing on companies minds <br/>
          Knowing how to test - One common complaint is that developers don't know how to test for accessibility
          using assistive readers or tools <br/>
          Time it takes to test - Another complaint is that companies say that it takes a while to build for
          accessibility. But if you build a website with accessibility in mind, it won't take up any more time to
          develop. <br/>
          Why improve on things you can't see - Just because you can't visually see the changes, doesn't mean that it
          wouldn't impact the web experience for others

            Some semantic elements can be used to describe the different parts of a web page <br/>
            For screen reader users, using semantic elements the browser can clearly articulate to the user what HTML
            element they are on, if it's a heading they can navigate by headings. If it's a list item, it can describe
            how many items are in the list.<br/>

            One way to go about doing it is to have a screen reader only class where it's visually hidden from the user but 
            is still readable for screen readers. A more helpful tip is to not have heading level and styling tightly coupled together.
            So then you would be able to use heading levels without the dependency on styling.<br/>

          <h3>Making non-interactive elements keyboard focusable</h3>
          <p>By default, links buttons and form controls are natively accessible for keyboard users.</p>
          <p>It's best to avoid using tabindex whenever possible. Use links, buttons, or form controls for interactivity.</p>
          <pre><code data-trim data-line-numbers>
            <div tabindex="0">Now this div tab is focusable</div>

        <h2>Color Contrast</h2>
        <p>For visual impaired users, having the correct color contrast on websites is vital in order for them to see your content visibily.</p>
        <p>You can utilize <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">WebAIM Color Contrast Picker</a> to compare foreground and background color palettes.</p>
        <p>You want to aim for WCAG AA compliance for both normal and large text, ideally you would want to get AAA compliance.</p>

          <h2>Multimedia Accessibility</h2>
          <p>For multimedia such as videos, it's generally good practice to have captions/subtitles for videos.</p>
          <p>If you're using iframes or embeds from videos such as Youtube or Vimeo, you can utilize the built in captioning system to make sure your video is accessible.</p>
          <pre><code data-trim data-line-numbers>
            <video id="sample_video" width="800" height="600" controls>
              <source src="sample_video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
              <source src="sample_video.webm" type="video/webm">
              <track label="English" kind="subtitles" srclang="en" src="REV_TRANSCRIPTION_V3.vtt" default>
            </video>
          </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Other ways to make multimedia videos accessible</h3>
          <p>Sign Language - Adding sign language so that deaf folks can get content in their native langage</p>
          <p>Description of Visual Information - Provide description so that people who are blind and others who cannot see the video adequately get the visual information needed to understand the content.</p>
          <p>Transcript - Providing a text version of speech and non-speech audio information. Descriptive transcripts would ideally provide text description of the visual information.</p>
          <p>Accessible Players - Using accessible video/audio players such as <a href="https://ableplayer.github.io/ableplayer/">AblePlayer</a> would do most of the heavy lifting so developers don't have to use customized solutions to make a player accessible.</p>
