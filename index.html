          <h2>Why Accessibility is Important</h2>
          <p>Inaccessible websites means that people with disabilities are denied equal access to get information.</p>
          <p>It can exclude people just as much as a physical location that has steps at an entrance. In a way excluding a person digitally is in a way a form of discrimination</p>

          <h2>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</h2>
          <p>Legislation passed in 1990 and amended in 2008, is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in everyday activities.</p>
          <p>The ADA applies to State and Local Goverments (Title II) as well as Businesses that are open to the public (Title III).</p>
          <p>Under Title III specifically, no individual may be discriminated against on the basis of disability with regards to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases, or operates a place of public accommodation.</p>
          <p>While not specificially mentioning websites in the Legislation, through court precedence, this act is assumed to extend beyond the physical space of businesses and governments - which would mean digital spaces including websites. Though in some circuit courts the website would have to be connected to a physical location whereas other circuit courts you can bring a lawsuit against an online-only business</p>
          <p>Over the years there has been an increasing number of Title III lawsuits and in 2020 alone there has been more than 2500 lawsuits regarding inaccessible websites</p>

                <li>8M (2.5%) people live with hearing impairments</li>

          <h2>Common Barriers for Accessibility</h2>
          <p>Time To Market - Because its a race to develop a fast viable working product. Accessibility is the last thing on companies minds</p>
          <p>Knowing how to test - One common complaint is that developers don't know how to test for accessibility using assistive readers or tools</p>
          <p>Time it takes to test - Another complaint is that companies say that it takes a while to build for accessibility. But if you build a website with accessibility in mind, it won't take up any more time to develop.</p>
          <p>Why improve on things you can't see - Just because you can't visually see the changes, doesn't mean that it wouldn't impact the web experience for others</p>

        <h2>Semantic HTML</h2>
        <p>Semantic elements clearly describes it's meaning to both the browser and developer</p>
        <p>Non Semantic Elements: <code>div</code> and <code>span</code></p>
        <p>Semantic Elements: <code>header</code>, <code>footer</code>, <code>nav</code>, and <code>main</code></p>
        <p>Some semantic elements can be used to describe the different parts of a web page</p>
        <p>For screen reader users, using semantic elements the browser can clearly articulate to the user what HTML element they are on, if it's a heading they can navigate by headings. If it's a list item, it can describe how many items are in the list.</p>
